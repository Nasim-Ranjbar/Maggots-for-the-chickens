 ## A cost-benefit comparison between the baseline (conventional feed) and the proposed intervention (Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL) feed)
 
The baseline is to continue feeding the current feed of maize meal and soybean concentrate mixture, while the intervention is to replace the soybean with Black Soldier Fly powder in the concentrate. 

To do this analysis, we first identified the decision maker as the poultry farm owner, and stakehoders as the offtakers of broilers and eggs, along with the end consumers. 

We then drew a decision model to clearly delineate the impact pathway between different cost, benefit and risk variables, as shown in the figure below.
