### Overview



<br>


### Literature Review



<br>


### Method


We used the `decisionSupport` package [@R-decisionSupport] to do a cost-benefit comparison between the baseline and the proposed intervention. The baseline is to continue feeding the current feed of maize meal and soybean concentrate mixture, while the intervention is to replace the soybean with Black Soldier Fly powder in the concentrate. 

To do this analysis, we first identified the decision maker as the poultry farm owner, and stakehoders as the offtakers of broilers and eggs, along with the end consumers. We then drew a decision model to clearly delineate the impact pathway between different cost, benefit and risk variables, as shown in the figure below. 

<br>

![***Impact Pathway Model showing Causal Relationships Between Costs, Benefits and Risk of the Intervention***](./impact_pathway_model.jpg){height=500px}

<br>

Estimate ranges for these various input variables were then collected from the decision maker and the stakeholders. We then built a [decision model in R](https://github.com/Nasim-Ranjbar/Maggots-for-the-chickens/blob/main/DA_project.R) that incorporates expert knowledge, inputs from decision maker and stakeholders, as well as literature findings, for a simulation period of twelve years. We calculated the net present values of the baseline and intervention to compare the future profits in present values. 

We then ran the *Monte Carlo Simulation* ten thousands times using the `mcSimulation()` function in the `decisionSupport` package to generate the model results. We also did a cashflow analysis of the two options across the simulation timeline, and a *Projection to Latent Structures (PLS)* analysis as a post-hoc test to the simulation outputs. We did a *Value of Information (VoI) analysis*, and used the `multi_EVPI()` to calculate the *Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI)*. The EVPI provides information on the expected opportunity loss due to uncertainty, if the decision maker does not have a perfect information about certain variables.

### Result

#### Comparison of Net Present Value (NPV) distributions

Compared to the baseline feed, the expected NPV distribution of the intervention using BSFL feed shows greater uncertainty, but also a higher potential for profit.

```{r result1}

DA_simulation_results <- mcSimulation(
  estimate = estimate_read_csv("data/DA_project.csv"),
  model_function = DA_function,
  numberOfModelRuns = 1e4, 
  functionSyntax = "plainNames")



# Plot distribution
plot_distributions(mcSimulation_object = DA_simulation_results, 
                   vars = c("NPV_baseline", 
                            "NPV_bsfl"),
                   old_names = c("NPV_baseline", "NPV_bsfl"),
                   new_names = c("NPV baseline feed", "NPV BSFL feed"),
                   method = 'smooth_simple_overlay', 
                   base_size = 7, 
                   x_axis_name = "Net Present Value (NPV) outcomes (GHC)")


```

<br>

The boxplots below show the median (central line), the 25th and 75th percentiles (edges of the box) and any outliers (light circles outside the boxes) of the two NPV distributions. 

```{r result2}

plot_distributions(mcSimulation_object = DA_simulation_results, 
                   vars = c("NPV_baseline","NPV_bsfl"),
                   old_names = c("NPV_baseline", "NPV_bsfl"),
                   new_names = c("NPV baseline feed", "NPV BSFL feed"),
                   method = "boxplot", 
                   base_size = 11, 
                   x_axis_name = "Net Present Value (NPV) outcomes (GHC)")

```

<br>

The figure below shows the distribution of the value of the decision&mdash; that is, the difference in the net present values (NPV) of the baseline and the intervention. It represents the expected outcome distribution if we make the decision to implement the intervention.

```{r result3}

plot_distributions(mcSimulation_object = DA_simulation_results, 
                   vars = "NPV_decision",
                   old_names = "NPV_decision",
                   new_names = "NPV decision",
                   method = "boxplot_density", 
                   base_size = 10, 
                   x_axis_name = "Net Present Value (NPV) outcomes (GHC)")

```

  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
    position = "center",   
    font_size = 12  
    )
  
```

#### Distribution of cost savings from the intervention

The motivation behind this intervention was the significantly lower cost of Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL) powder compared to soybean meal. The figures below show the cost avoided by implementing the intervention and the cost savings from replacing feed with BSFL.

    )

```

#### Cashflow analysis

The side-by-side comparison between the annual cashflows of the baseline and the intervention across the twelve years of simulation period is shown below. 

A dip in the cashflows can be seen every four years of the simulation period. This is in line with the operation structure of the model farm. The farm purchases day-old chicks in batches in a three-year cycle (3-2-0)&mdash; purchase three batches in the first year, followed by a batch purchase in the second year and no batch purchase in the third year. The chicks take four months of maturation period before laying eggs for the next 32 months&mdash. By the 37^th^month (the 4^th^ year), the spent hens are sold in batches, while replacing each batch sold with a new batch of day-old chicks. This event is indicated in the cashflow plots as a periodic dip every four year, when profit loss occurs with four months of egg-free period for the new chicks (maturation period) and no egg production after the sale of spent hens. 

The annual casflow of the intervention displays wider margin for the percent quantile values, reflecting higher uncertainties in building the intervention model. 

```{r result9}

plot_cashflow(mcSimulation_object = DA_simulation_results,
              cashflow_var_name = c("Cashflow_baseline", "Cashflow_bsfl"),
              x_axis_name = "Year",
              y_axis_name = "Cashflow in Ghanaian Cedi (GHC)") 

```

<br>

#### Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) analysis

The figure below presents the variables most influential in predicting the decision outcomes, as identified by PLS analysis. The selling price per crate of 30 eggs is the most dominant variable in the outcome of both baseline and intervention models. The decision on whether to implement intervention is mostly influenced by the cost of BSFL powder and the increased cost of farm activities required to meet potential demand surges due to boosted sales.
